		<h2> Tournament Proxy Policy </h2>
		<p>
			Proxies will be legal to play with in HPTCG Revival Events. The decision to do so is to foster growth for Harry Potter TCG, the community, and to ensure accessibility for as many players as possible.
			</br>
			In the near future, the Revival Team will be releasing resources and tools to assist in the process of creating high quality printed cards at home.
			<ol>
				<li>All cards produced by Wizards of the Coast or the Revival Team are printable and legal for use in sanctioned events.
				<li>The print quality of the card must be as high as reasonably possible, the printed card must be in color, and all relevant text must be readable and with no alterations to the card. Printable cards should not be printed on any kind of non-standard paper that will distort the image or allow the cards to be marked or otherwise detected.
				<li>When a player is using printed and physical cards, they should take into account the thickness of cards within sleeves to make them indistinguishable from each other so as to not create marked cards.
				<li>Players should use high quality opaque sleeves to ehlp mitigate the possibility of marked cards within decks.
				<li>Quality of printing and sleeves can vary greatly. If a player is worried about their deck, they should ask the tournament organizer for approval of their printing and sleeving for the event.

	 	<ul>
	 		<li>Each player may have a sideboard, which is a group of no more than ten (10) additional cards the player may use to modify their deck between games of a match. The four-card limit applies to the combined deck and sideboard. In limited play involving individual players, all cards in a player's card pool not included in their deck are in that player's sideboard.</li>

		<h2>Tournament FAQs</h2>
		<p>
		<strong>Q. Who decides to go first?</strong></br>
		A. For in person events, the winner of a coin toss (or other random method) chooses who plays first. For tournaments that include more than one game per match, after each game in a match, the loser of that game (even if the game loss was due to a penalty) decides whether to play first in the next game. If the game was a draw (so there was no winner or loser), the player who decided who played first for that game chooses for the next game.</br>
		For virtual tournaments, Game 1 in swiss rounds use the roll dice function. For games 2 and 3, the loser of the previous game will have choice of going first or second. For the top 8 the higher seed will have choice.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. What is the mulligan rule?</strong></br>
		A. In Revival Format you're allowed one mulligan. Shuffle your hand back into your deck and draw a new hang of 7 cards.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. How do sideboards works?</strong></br>
		A. You're allowed a 10 card sideboard in the Revival Format. For games 2 and 3, you can swap cards from your deck and your sideboard, but make sure your deck is always 60 cards.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. What cards are authorized for paper tournament play?</strong></br>
		A. All Harry Potter cards, including promotional cards released by Wizards of the Coast, Inc., are legal for tournament play. Non–local language cards may be used in players’ decks only if the same cards are available in a local-language version produced by Wizards of the Coast. If no cards are produced in a local language, then the tournament organizer must announce what language will be considered the local language for the event. Players choosing to play with non–local-language cards must have a local language version available outside of their decks for their opponents or the judge to reference. However, players may use Lesson cards in any language without providing a local-language equivalent.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. What do I need to bring to a tournament?</strong></br>
		A. A player must bring a method of tracking card effects (creature damage, skipped Actions, “once per game” character abilities, and so on), such as tokens or dice.</br></br>

		<strong style="font-size: 20pt;"><u>For virtual tournaments only:</u></strong></br></br>
		<strong>Q. Where do I find my opponent's hash?</strong></br>
		A. The Rules and Signup has each player's discord tag and deck hash.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. How do I call a judge?</strong></br>
		A. Please ask your question in the Judge Questions channel in discord, using the @Judge tag. Please pause your game timers, as it might take judges a few minutes to respond.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. Is a judge available to watch my entire game?</strong></br>
		A. No, judges will be able to help with quesitons or match problems, but cannot commit to watching everyone's games.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. How long will the tournament last?</strong></br>
		A. Around 15 days for swiss rounds and addition time for top 8.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. How long are rounds and matches?</strong></br>
		A. Rounds: 72 hours.</br>
		A. Matches: 90 minutes for best of 3.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. What's the end of match procedure?</strong></br>
		A. Each player should keep a timer and try to sync up with each other when starting. Matches should last no longer than 90 minutes. At the 90 minute mark, each player will get 3 more full turns, including the player whose turn it is. </br></br>
		<strong>Q. How do I coordinate playing with my opponent?</strong></br>
		A. Message your opponents directly in a private message. When playing, call or chat with them via private message or use a Table in our discord server.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. What if we can't coordinate a time to play?</strong></br>
		A. Failure for one party to find availability to play their match will result in a match loss. Failure for both parties to coordinate a time to play their match will be scored as a tie.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. What is a bye?</strong></br>
		A. In Swiss tournaments, if the number of players in the round is uneven, then there will be one player with no one to play against that round. This unmatched player gets what is called a 'bye'. A bye means you do not play a game that round, but still get 3 points as if you had won a game.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. Can I intentially end a game in a draw?</strong></br>
		A. We do not allow intentional draws and ask everyone to play all of their matches. Draws don't give new players a better tournament experience and can potentially discourage some from signing up for future events. This would mean lower event turnout and smaller player base. This is not something that we can easily enforce online, but hope that you will try your best for the event and players to play each and every game out.
