		<h2>Tournament FAQs</h2>
		<p>
		<strong>Q. Who decides to go first?</strong></br>
		A. Game 1 in swiss rounds use the roll dice function. For games 2 and 3, the loser of the previous game will have choice of going first or second. For the top 8 the higher seed will have choice.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. What is the mulligan rule?</strong></br>
		A. In Revival Format you're allowed one mulligan. Shuffle your hand back into your deck and draw a new hang of 7 cards.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. How do sideboards works?</strong></br>
		A. You're allowed a 10 card sideboard in the Revival Format. For games 2 and 3, you can swap cards from your deck and your sideboard, but make sure your deck is always 60 cards.</br></br>
		<strong style="font-size: 20pt;"><u>For virtual tournaments only:</u></strong></br></br>
		<strong>Q. Where do I find my opponent's hash?</strong></br>
		A. The Rules and Signup has each player's discord tag and deck hash.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. How do I call a judge?</strong></br>
		A. Please ask your question in the Judge Questions channel in discord, using the @Judge tag. Please pause your game timers, as it might take judges a few minutes to respond.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. Is a judge available to watch my entire game?</strong></br>
		A. No, judges will be able to help with quesitons or match problems, but cannot commit to watching everyone's games.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. How long will the tournament last?</strong></br>
		A. Around 15 days for swiss rounds and addition time for top 8.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. How long are rounds and matches?</strong></br>
		A. Rounds: 72 hours.</br>
		A. Matches: 90 minutes for best of 3.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. What's the end of match procedure?</strong></br>
		A. Each player should keep a timer and try to sync up with each other when starting. Matches should last no longer than 90 minutes. At the 90 minute mark, each player will get 3 more full turns, including the player whose turn it is. </br></br>
		<strong>Q. How do I coordinate playing with my opponent?</strong></br>
		A. Message your opponents directly in a private message. When playing, call or chat with them via private message or use a Table in our discord server.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. What if we can't coordinate a time to play?</strong></br>
		A. Failure for one party to find availability to play their match will result in a match loss. Failure for both parties to coordinate a time to play their match will be scored as a tie.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. What is a bye?</strong></br>
		A. In Swiss tournaments, if the number of players in the round is uneven, then there will be one player with no one to play against that round. This unmatched player gets what is called a 'bye'. A bye means you do not play a game that round, but still get 3 points as if you had won a game.</br></br>
		<strong>Q. Can I intentially end a game in a draw?</strong></br>
		A. We do not allow intentional draws and ask everyone to play all of their matches. Draws don't give new players a better tournament experience and can potentially discourage some from signing up for future events. This would mean lower event turnout and smaller player base. This is not something that we can easily enforce online, but hope that you will try your best for the event and players to play each and every game out.
